# 💡 Logotype, Isotype, Imagotype, and Isologo: The Anatomy of Your Visual Identity

The logo is the face of your brand, its first impression, and the visual anchor of your business. But did you know that the word "logo" is often used incorrectly? In professional design, not all graphics that identify a brand are technically a "Logotype."

Understanding the difference between the **four main types of logos** is crucial for knowing what you truly need and how your brand will perform in the digital and physical world.

## 4 Keys to Classifying a Logo

The classification is based on the relationship between the **text** (the brand name) and the **symbol** (the icon or drawing).

### 1. The Logotype (or *Wordmark*)
* **Definition:** It is the graphical representation of the brand composed **exclusively of text**.
* **Key:** **Typography** is the main element. The font design, color, and spacing define the identity.
* **When to use it?** Ideal for brands with short, catchy names or those seeking direct name recognition (like the main version of the Google logo).
* **Examples:** Coca-Cola, Google, Canon.

#### Key Subtype: The Monogram (*Lettermark*)
* **Definition:** A type of logotype that uses **the initials or a single letter** of the brand as the main graphic element.
* **Key:** It works as an abbreviation and concentrates the identity into one or a couple of characters.
* **When to use it?** It is excellent for very long or complex brand names (such as the "G" of Google in its applications, or the "M" of McDonald's in some contexts).
* **Examples:** IBM, HBO, CNN.

### 2. The Isotype (or Symbol)
* **Definition:** It is the graphical representation of the brand composed **exclusively of a symbol or icon**, without text.
* **Key:** The symbol must be so strong and memorable that it identifies the brand on its own.
* **When to use it?** It is used when the brand already has a high level of recognition and can afford to omit the name. It works perfectly for app icons (*favicons*).
* **Iconic Examples:** Apple (the bitten apple), Nike (the *swoosh*).

### 3. The Imagotype
* **Definition:** It is the combination of a **symbol and text** that work together, but that **can be separated** and still be individually recognizable.
* **Key:** It is the most versatile option. You can use the symbol alone in small spaces and the full set in headers or stationery.
* **When to use it?** It is an excellent option for new or growing brands that need to build an association between their name and their symbol.
* **Examples:** Adidas, Puma.

### 4. The Isologo (or *Isologotype*)
* **Definition:** It is the combination of a **symbol and text that are fused or grouped inseparably**.
* **Key:** The text is integrated within the shape or symbol. If separated, the logo loses its identity and recognition.
* **When to use it?** When seeking a unique, cohesive image where typography and symbol reinforce each other.
* **Examples:** Lay's, NASA, Pizza Hut.

> 🌟 **The Golden Rule:** If you try to separate the text from the symbol and the result feels empty, incomplete, or fails to represent the brand, you have an **Isologo**. If both elements function separately, you have an [Imagotype.](#3-the-imagotype)
