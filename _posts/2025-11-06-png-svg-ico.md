A digital logo requires at least three key formats to function correctly in all contexts. Each one has a specific mission:

### 1. The Master File: SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

The file guarantees infinite quality regardless of size, as it is based on mathematical formulas and not on pixels (the small squares seen when enlarging an image), allowing it to be used in prints, websites at different resolutions, among many other things.

At Stairway, we do this job for you for a modest price of $14990. [Contact us via Messenger.](https://m.me/106648708512872)

### 2. The Web File: PNG (Portable Network Graphics)

The standard for use on most websites. It supports **transparency**, which is crucial for the logo to float over any background. It is a pixel file, but without lossy compression. Its **Typical Use** is on websites, digital documents, and social media.

### 3. The Solution File: ICO (Icon)

The small and famous icon in the browser tab. Designed to contain multiple resolutions (16x16, 32x32) in a single file. Typical use in browser tabs, bookmarks, and desktop shortcuts.

# Conclusion

A professional logo package must include these three formats to ensure the client can use their brand anywhere, from a tiny favicon to a vector billboard, encompassing the logotype, icon (isotype), representative colors, and typography, among others, which will give their brand a unique presence.
