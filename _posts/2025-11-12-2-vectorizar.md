title: "What is Vectorization and Why is it Vital for a Logo?"
---

If you've ever tried to enlarge a logo only for it to end up looking blurry and pixelated, the answer lies in **vectorization**.

## 1. What is Vectorization?

Vectorization is, in essence, the process of converting a pixel-based image (bitmap or raster) into a vector-based graphic.

A vector graphic (like the [SVG]({% post_url 2025-11-06-png-svg-ico %}) format) is not made up of pixels (color dots), but by **mathematical formulas**. These formulas define lines, curves, and shapes. It's as if the file saves the instruction: _Draw a red circle with a radius of 5 cm._

<p>This mathematical nature is what makes vectorization vital, as it achieves:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Perfect Quality:</strong> The logo will look sharp and without loss of quality, whether printed on a business card (small) or a billboard (giant).</li>
    <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> You can easily modify colors and shapes without having to start over.</li>
</ul>

## 2. The Master Format: SVG

The most common format for vector graphics on the web is **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)**. This is the **master** file that every professional designer delivers to their client.

_With **Stairway Logos** you will not only get the **SVG** format, but also various resolutions in .png and .jpeg ready for use on social media, websites, and tax documents, along with an important detailed manual of the colors and typography that give your brand its image._
